The project assumes that you have
Version 5.5 of the CUDA toolkit 

It no longer assumes CULA. 

It no longer uses the CUDA SDK. 

BOOST is used in a limited way. www.boost.org

The kooql project uses QuantLib and this must be installed and built. 
The kooql project is not needed for the other projects. 

The code has only been tested using  x64 with Visual studio 11
 in Debug and Release modes. It currently assumes 3.5 architecture
but should build and run less efficiently for architectures >= 1.3. 
It ought to work with lower versions of Visual Studio but you would
have to create your own solution files. 

The Visual studio solution is in the folder. 

\kooderive\build\vs2012\kooderive

Make sure before building that you have set the configuration to x64.
The nvcc compiler breaks on some of the files in Win32 and if you use
accidentally used a mixed configuration, it won't build. 

The testing is done using a K20c. The code is optimized for that case. 
 It has also been tested on a Tesla C1060 and a Quadro 600. 


To add new .cu file

add to project 

Note you can specify properties for all .cu files by using the
properties of the project and looking at the bottom for the CUDA build
rule.
